Hackathon #3 Submission

Overview:

This repository contains the completed submissions for Hackathon #3, including all six days of tasks. Each day's documentation is stored in a dedicated folder with PDF/PNG files as per the requirements for that particular day.

Summary:

Initial Progress:

Day 1 & Day 2: Worked on the provided Template (4) and created documentation accordingly. All requirements were successfully met for these days.

Mid-Hackathon Adjustment:

Day 3: Encountered issues with the provided schema templates from the teachers:

Errors were occurring in the schema templates.

Data was not fetching properly despite multiple debugging attempts.

As a result, I chose to shift my focus back to my own project, Ann Fashion Store, to meet the requirements of day 3.

Final Progress:

Days 4-6: Continued working on my project, which involved fetching data from Sanity CMS and displaying products. This project was able to fulfill the requirements for the remaining days.

All documentation for Days 3-6 was created based on my project.

Repository Structure:

Each day's documentation is saved in a separate folder:

Day 1: Template (4) documentation (PDF/PNG)

Day 2: Template (4) documentation (PDF/PNG)

Day 3: Shifted to the project; documentation reflects data fetched from Sanity CMS (PDF/PNG)

Days 4-6: Documentation based on project functionalities (PDF/PNG)

Additional Notes:

The shift from Template (4) to a project-based approach from Day 3 onwards was necessary to ensure functionality and fulfill hackathon requirements.

All documentation reflects the work completed and is aligned with hackathon objectives.
